This software package is to be used for segmentation of unsegmented or improperly
segmented translation hypotheses according to the segments defined in the
multiple reference translations.

The package contains:

mwerSegmenter:         the C++ binary which performs the segmentation

hyp2sgm.py
sgm2mref.py :          two Python scripts to convert to/from SGML files

normalizeTextNIST.pl:  a perl script which can perform text normalization which
                       is used in NIST MT evaluations.

segmentBasedOnMWER.sh: a bash shell script which performs segmentation and
                       outputs a SGML file with proper segments.

A short help is shown by all programs and scripts, when called with the -h
option.

To install the tools:

1) put them all in a separate directory 
2) edit the script segmentBasedOnMWER.sh manually and set the variable SCRIPTDIR
to the global path to this directory
   For example, export SCRIPTDIR=/usr/test/mwerSegmenter

Note that the tools run only on Unix/Linux i686 machines and 
require a recent installation of Perl and Python.

To perform segmentation, run:

./segmentBasedOnMWER.sh <parameters>

The parameters are as follows:

<source sgm file> <reference sgm file> <translation file> <sysid> <target language> <output sgm file> [normalize]


<source sgm file>: the SGML file containing source segments/sentences (may have multiple docs)
<reference sgm file>:  the (multiple) reference translations of the source SGML file
<translation file>:    translation hypotheses for all of the original source segments 
                       in plain text, without any XML tags. The order of translation must match
                       the original order of the source segments. Any whitespace can be used
                       to separate words. The newline symbols may define some implicit segmentation,
                       but they will not be used by the algorithm.
<sysid>:               ID of the system which produced the translation, i.e. RWTH-primary-1
<target language>:     a name of the target language (e.g. English, Spanish)
<output sgm file>:     the name of the output SGML file with segmented translation hypotheses. 
                       This file can be directly used by all of the evaluation scripts.
[normalize]:           an optional parameter. By writing "normalize" both the translation input
                       and the references are normalized using the script normalizeTextNIST.pl.
                       Normalization may improve the accuracy of segmentation. However,
                       only case-insensitive evaluation will then be possible.
